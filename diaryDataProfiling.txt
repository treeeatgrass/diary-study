rawdata -> clean data to be upload to MendeleyData

Problem: too many missing data (more than 50%) for the qualitative questions
solution: check the pencil-and-paper questionnaire and realized that lots of the answers were not entered to the rawdata file.

Problem: data entry errors (such as 12 for a 5-point Likert scale item)
Solution: arrange each variable from large to small and correct the obvious errors (e.g., replace 22 with 2). 

Problem: some data entry errors were not obvious (e.g., 13 on a 5-point Likert scale item)
Solution: check the pencil-and-paper questionnaires to find the correct entry.

Problem: same response for consequtive items, which might indicate careless responses.
Solution: use the "careless"  package in R to calculate the number of consecutive responses.

Problem: not many incidence of certain behavior (e.g., used smartphone yesterday after unhappy event)
Solution: re-code the qualitative data into more frequent behaviors (e.g., used electronic devices yesterday after unhappy event).

Problem: some values in FirstMotivation are lower case letters and others are upper case letters.
Solution: recode a into A, recode b into B, recode c into C, recode d into D, recode e into E, recode f into F.

Problem: this was a 15-day daily diary study but some participants only provided valid data for 0 day or 1 day.
Solution: delete those participants from level1 data.
